# jam
Jecs and Matter jammed together as Jam frankensteins the topographic runtime from [Matter](https://github.com/matter-ecs/matter) to work with [Jecs](https://github.com/ukendio/jecs) and [Jabby](https://github.com/alicesaidhi/jabby) so that you can use and make hooks (includes a scheduler that works with Jabby and supports the topo runtime)
